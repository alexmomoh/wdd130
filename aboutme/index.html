    <p>Good day all. I find it a great pleasure pursuing a Bsc Degree in Software Development from BYU-Idaho, a dream come through.
       I am from Freetown, Sierra Leone where I reside in a community along the Atlantic Beach. During my free time, I love having 
       walk along the beach, enjoying the ambiance of the atmosphere especially during the dry season (Summer).</p>
       <p>One of the things I love about BYU-Idaho is their learning model, integrating the gospel of Jesus Christ into academia. 
        I see great advantage in studying Software Development as our world today is a technology driven one.</p>
        <p>I am a member of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Days Saint for over 25 years. One of my favourite scriptures 
            is Mosiah 2:17 "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the 
            service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."</p>
            <p>It is a great pleasure meeting you and I look forward to learning and growing.</p>
